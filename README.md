## Description

This is the Front-End to my Northcoers NC News project built using React js and using my own Back-end API hosted on Heroku.

Northcoders News is a social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website along the lines of Reddit.

Northcoders News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about an article. Comments can also be up or down voted. A user can add comments and remove any comments which they have added.

Some functionality has been disabled unless the user is logged in, a suggested default username is 'jessjelly'
